# Veenote Frontend

## About the Project

Veenote is an open-source platform that enhances learning from online videos by allowing users to bookmark key moments and add notes for
quick reference. With features like collections, organized topics, and timestamped notes, Veenote transforms passive video watching into an
interactive, active learning experience. Ideal for students, professionals, or anyone looking to master new skills, Veenote makes reviewing
and retaining information easier and more effective.

## Stack and Tools

This frontend for Veenote is built with a modern React-based stack, using Vite as the development server for fast build times. The
application leverages **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and customizable design system, while **React Router** enables seamless navigation
between pages. API calls are managed with **Axios**, allowing for efficient data handling and integration with the backend.
